            <p>
                Car Rentals allows users to rent or hire cars of their choice, user can add cars to their favorite list as well
            </p>

            <h4 class="project-info-title">How it was built</h4>
            <p>
                I built the backend using Ruby-on-Rails with JSON Web Token for authorization and authentication.
                And the frontend was built using React and Redux.
            </p>


            <h4 class="project-info-title">Challenge I ran into</h4>
            <p>
                After completing the app development, tested it locally everything worked as expected.
                However, after pushing it to Heroku, I JWT used for authentication was not working as expected, spent the whole 
                day troubleshooting this. Thanks to stackoverflow and google final was able to resolve it the next day. I did 
                not include the secrets.yml file to target production environment.
