            <h4 class="project-info-title">What it does</h4>
            <p>It allows users on the platform to send and receive messages from each other in real-time.</p>

            <h4 class="project-info-title">How it was built</h4>
            <p>I made use of HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the frontend. This enabled me to style the website and make Ajax calls using javascript to run my PHP code in the back end. PHP which was used in the backend allowed me to store data, and update data which made the site work. Real-time communicate was achieved by means of Ajax calls</p>


            <h4 class="project-info-title">Challenge we ran into</h4>
            <p>I was faced with the issue of synchronizing the message between two users and using a notification of a new message on the users' page. </p>
