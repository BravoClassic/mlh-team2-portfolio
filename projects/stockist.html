            <p>
                The app uses the Financial API to list latest stocks allowing users to filter the most active,
                gainers and losers. The user can also search for individual stocks. For more details see project

            <h4 class="project-info-title">How it was built</h4>
            <p>
                I made use of the React and Redux with Financial Stock API and Bootstrap to style the application.

            <h4 class="project-info-title">Challenge I ran into</h4>
            <p>
                It was first time working with Financial Stock API, using axios and deciding which endpoint
                to fetch as well as deciding on the app flow and layout was my major challenge.
